## WeatherBit

WeatherBit is a simple weather forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch 7 days forecast data.
API used in the project:
- https://open-meteo.com/en/docs - for the weather forecast
- https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api - for geocoding and city suggestions
- https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/ - for reverse geocoding (to get city name from coordinates)
